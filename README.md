# Minirigs reverse engineering

I absolutely ❤️ my minirigs but the app can use some polishing. 
It's time to change that. My first step is to provide some proper documentation of the protocol the speakers use.
After that let's start some app building. :)

# Roadmap
- [x]  Decompile android app
- [ ]  (In progress) Rename obfuscated methods/classes to something meaningful.
- [ ]  Document the protocol
- [ ]  Create a library for people to use.
